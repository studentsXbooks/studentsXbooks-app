        Through our site you can buy books much cheaper than what your college
        would sell you through their company backed online stores or through
        their on campus bookstores. If you have an unneeded book from a previous
        semester or year then you can sell the book on this site for a better
        deal than what a college would buy it for through their on campus
        bookstore. Also, unlike other ecommerce sites, there are no fees for
        listing, selling, or purchasing books on this site. We are here to help
        students make it through college without paying the outrageous prices on
        textbooks when the tuition alone is already expensive enough.
