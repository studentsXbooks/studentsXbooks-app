    <p>What our site does to help students</p>
    <p>
      We want to improve the way students can purchase their textbooks for their
      classes, as well as allow students an easier way to offload books they no
      longer need or want to keep around. We want our site to make it easier and
      more cost effective for students so that they can make their dreams a
      reality in the future.
